Applications that are built for the Cloud often need adapt to running in a Cloud environment, read and share configuration in a distributed manner and externalize configuration to the environment where necessary.

Micronaut's <<environments, Environment>> concept is by default Cloud platform aware and will make a best effort to detect the underlying active environment.

You can then use the api:context.annotation.Requires[] annotation to <<conditionalBeans,conditionally load bean definitions>>.

The following table summarizes the constants provided by the api:context.env.Environment[] interface and provides an example:

.Micronaut Environment Detection
|===
|Constant|Description |Requires Example

|api:context.env.Environment#ANDROID[]
|The application is running as an Android application
|`@Requires(env = Environment.ANDROID)`

|api:context.env.Environment#TEST[]
|The application is running within a JUnit or Spock test
|`@Requires(env = Environment.TEST)`

|api:context.env.Environment#CLOUD[]
|The application is running in a Cloud environment (present for all other cloud platform types)
|`@Requires(env = Environment.CLOUD)`

|api:context.env.Environment#AMAZON_EC2[]
|Running on https://aws.amazon.com/ec2[Amazon EC2]
|`@Requires(env = Environment.AMAZON_EC2)`

|api:context.env.Environment#GOOGLE_COMPUTE[]
|Running on https://cloud.google.com/compute/[Google Compute]
|`@Requires(env = Environment.GOOGLE_COMPUTE)`

|api:context.env.Environment#KUBERNETES[]
|Running on https://www.kubernetes.io[Kubernetes]
|`@Requires(env = Environment.KUBERNETES)`

|api:context.env.Environment#HEROKU[]
|Running on https://heroku.com[Heroku]
|`@Requires(env = Environment.HEROKU)`

|api:context.env.Environment#CLOUD_FOUNDRY[]
|Running on https://www.cloudfoundry.org[Cloud Foundry]
|`@Requires(env = Environment.CLOUD_FOUNDRY)`

|===

Note that it may be that case that you have multiple active environment names since you may run Kubernetes on AWS for example.

In addition, using the value of the constants defined in the table above you can create environment specific configuration files. For example if you create a `src/main/resources/application-gcp.yml` file then that configuration will only be loaded when running on Google Compute.

TIP: Any configuration property in the api:context.env.Environment[] can also be set via an environment variable. For example, setting the `CONSUL_CLIENT_HOST` environment variable will override the `host` property in api:discovery.consul.ConsulConfiguration[].

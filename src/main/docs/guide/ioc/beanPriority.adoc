`@Primary` is a qualifier that indicates that a bean is the primary bean that should be selected in the case of multiple possible interface implementations.

Check this example:

[source,java]
----
include::{testshttpservernetty}/context/annotation/primary/Green.groovy[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testshttpservernetty}/context/annotation/primary/Green.groovy[tags=clazz, indent=0]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{testshttpservernetty}/context/annotation/primary/Blue.groovy[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testshttpservernetty}/context/annotation/primary/Blue.groovy[tags=clazz, indent=0]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{testshttpservernetty}/context/annotation/primary/ColorPicker.groovy[tags=clazz, indent=0]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{testshttpservernetty}/context/annotation/primary/TestController.groovy[tags=clazz, indent=0]
----

<1> Although there are two `ColorPicker` beans, `Green` gets injected due to the `@Primary` annotation.

The classic requirement of dependency injection is the interface and multiple possible implementations.

Once again Micronaut leverages JSR-303 and the link:{jeeapi}/javax/inject/Qualifier.html[Qualifier] and link:{jeeapi}/javax/inject/Named.html[Named] annotations to support this use case.

=== Qualifying By Name

To qualify by name you can use the link:{jeeapi}/javax/inject/Named.html[Named] annotation. For example, consider the following classes:

[source,groovy]
----
import javax.inject.*

include::{testsdir}/qualifiers/named/Engine.groovy[tags=class, indent=0]

include::{testsdir}/qualifiers/named/V6Engine.groovy[tags=class, indent=0]

include::{testsdir}/qualifiers/named/V8Engine.groovy[tags=class, indent=0]

include::{testsdir}/qualifiers/named/Vehicle.groovy[tags=class, indent=0]
----

<1> The `Engine` interface defines the common contract
<2> The `V6Engine` class is the first implementation
<3> The `V8Engine` class is the second implementation
<4> The link:{jeeapi}/javax/inject/Named.html[Named] annotation is used to indicate the `V8Engine` implementation is required
<5> Calling the start method prints: `"Starting V8"`

=== Qualifying By Annotation

In addition to being able to qualify by name, you can build your own qualifiers using the link:{jeeapi}/javax/inject/Qualifier.html[Qualifier] annotation. For example, consider the following annotation:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsdir}/qualifiers/annotation/V8.groovy[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testsdir}/qualifiers/annotation/V8.groovy[tags=class, indent=0]
----

The above annotation is itself annotated with the `@Qualifier` annotation to designate it as a qualifier. You can then use the annotation at any injection point in your code. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsdir}/qualifiers/annotation/Vehicle.groovy[tags=constructor, indent=0]
----

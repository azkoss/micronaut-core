The link:{api}/org/particleframework/context/BeanContext.html[BeanContext] is a container object for all your bean definitions (it also implements link:{api}/org/particleframework/context/BeanDefinitionRegistry.html[BeanDefinitionRegistry]).

It is also the point of initialization for Particle. Generally speaking however, you don't have to interact directly with the `BeanContext` API and can simply use `javax.inject` annotations and the annotations defined within link:{api}/org/particleframework/context/annotation/index.html[org.particleframework.context.annotation] package for your dependency injection needs.

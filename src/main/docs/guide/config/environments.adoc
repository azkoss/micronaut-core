The active environment names serve the purpose of allowing loading different configuration files depending on the environment and also using the link:{api}/org/particleframework/context/annotation/Requires.html[@Requires] annotation to conditionally load beans or bean link:{api}/org/particleframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html[@Configuration] packages.

To run your function as a web application as described in this section, you will need the `function-web` dependency on your classpath. For example, in `build.gradle`

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
runtime "io.micronaut:function-web"
----




Function-web will allow you to run a function as a web app, register with consul if configured, access from function client. Function client will auto discover functions on consul run with function-web. Run functions locally and then deploy to cloud provider without changing client.

Same in tests (use function-web as test dependency)

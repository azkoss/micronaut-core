Micronaut is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Micro Services framework designed for building modular, easily testable Micro Service applications.

Micronaut is developed by the creators of the Grails framework and takes inspiration from lessons learnt over the years building real-world applications from monoliths to Micro Services using Spring, Spring Boot and Grails.

Micronaut aims to provide all the tools necessary to build Micro Service applications including:

* Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (IoC)
* Sensible Defaults and Auto-Configuration
* Configuration and Configuration Sharing
* Service Discovery
* HTTP Routing
* HTTP Client with Client-Side Load Balancing

At the same time Micronaut aims to avoid the downsides of frameworks like Spring, Spring Boot and Grails by providing:

* Fast startup time
* Reduced memory footprint
* Minimal use of reflection
* Minimal use of proxies
* Easy Unit Testing

Whilst frameworks like Spring and Grails were never designed to run in scenarios such as as functions on a Server-less platform, or on Android or as a low memory footprint Micro Service; Micronaut on the other hand is designed to be suitable for all of these scenarios.

The way this is achieved is through a series of Java annotation processors, that are usable on any JVM language that supports them, and an HTTP Server and Client built on Netty.

The purpose of the annotation processors is to provide a similar programming model to Spring and Grails, but by pre-compiling all the information necessary to perform DI, define AOP proxies and configure your application to run in a Micro Services environment.

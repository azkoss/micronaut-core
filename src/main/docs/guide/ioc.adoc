When most developers think of Inversion of Control (also known as Dependency Injection and referred to as such from this point onwards) the Spring Framework comes to mind.

Particle takes heavy inspiration from Spring, and in fact, the core developers of Particle are former SpringSource/Pivotal engineers now working for https://objectcomputing.com[OCI].

Unlike Spring which relies exclusively on runtime reflection and proxies, Particle, on the other hand, uses compile time data to implement dependency injection.

This is a similar approach taken by tools such as Google's https://google.github.io/dagger/[Dagger], which is designed primarily with Android in mind. Particle, on the other hand, is designed for building server-side Micro Services and provides many of the same tools and utilities as Spring does but without using reflection.

The goals of the Particle IoC container are summarized as:

* Use reflection as a last resort
* Avoid proxies
* Optimize start-up time
* Reduce memory footprint
* Provide clear, understandable error handling

The Particle HTTP server supports the ability to apply filters to request/response processing in a similar, but reactive, way to Servlet filters in traditional Java applications.

Filters provide the ability to support the following use cases:

* Decoration of the incoming api:http.HttpRequest[]
* Modification of the outgoing api:http.HttpResponse[]
* Implementation of cross cutting concerns such as security, tracing etc.

For a server application, the api:http.filter.HttpServerFilter[] interface's `doFilter` method can be implemented.

The `doFilter` method accepts the api:http.HttpRequest[] and an instance of api:http.filter.ServerFilterChain[].

The `ServerFilterChain` interface contains a resolved chain of filters with the final entry in the chain being the matched route. The api:http.filter.ServerFilterChain.proceed(org.particleframework.http.HttpRequest)[] method can be used to resume processing of the request.

The `proceed(..)` method returns a Reactive Streams rs:Publisher[] that emits the response that will be returned to the client. Implementors of filters can subscribe to the rs:Publisher[] and mutate the emitted api:http.MutableHttpResponse[] object to modify the response prior to returning the response to the client.

To put these concepts into practise lets look at an example.

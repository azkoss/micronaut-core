As mentioned previously, Micronaut is both an HTTP server and an HTTP client. A low-level HTTP client is provided out of the box which you can use to test the `HelloController` created in the previous section.

For example, the following test is written using http://spockframework.org[Spock Framework]:

.Testing Hello World
[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsuite}/server/intro/HelloControllerSpec.groovy[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testsuite}/server/intro/HelloControllerSpec.groovy[tags=class, indent=0]
----

<1> The api:runtime.server.EmbeddedServer[] is configured as a shared and automatically cleaned up test field
<2> A api:http.client.HttpClient[] instance shared field is also defined
<3> The test using the `toBlocking()` method to make a blocking call
<4> The `retrieve` method returns the response of the controller as a `String`

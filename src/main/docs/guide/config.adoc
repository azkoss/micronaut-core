Configuration in Micronaut takes inspiration from both Spring Boot and Grails and integrates them directly into the core IoC container.

Configuration can by default be provided in either Java properties, YAML, JSON or Groovy files. The convention is to search for a file called `application.yml`, `application.properties`, `application.json` or `application.groovy`.

In addition, Micronaut will search for the system properties and environment variables for configuration allow the ability to conveniently override settings at the system property or environment variable level.

Each source of configuration is modeled with the link:{api}/org/particleframework/context/env/PropertySource.html[PropertySource] interface and the mechanism is extensible allowing the implementation of additional link:{api}/org/particleframework/context/env/PropertySourceLoader.html[PropertySourceLoader] implementations.

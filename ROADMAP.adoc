# Particle Requirements

## Minimum Feature Set

The following features are a TODO list of things to do on Particle before launching

### Core Features

#### Generic Type Abstraction for Factory Beans

This is currently not possible due to type erasure:

```
@Factory
class TypeConverterFactory {

    TypeConverter<String, Integer> typeConverter() {
        (string, integer, context) -> {
           // do conversion
        }
    }
}
```

At compile time we know the types but at runtime the lambda loses type information. We need to add an API to obtain type information for a bean from the factory.

#### AOP API

We need to allow `Introduction` advise to specify additional interfaces that should be be implemented by the interceptor.

#### Aspect Implementations

We need to implement AOP annotations for:

- Retry
- Hystrix
- Scheduled

#### Configuration Sharing

Need a mechanism for configuration discovery and sharing across the federation

### Management Features

#### Endpoints

We need endpoints for managing and/or exposing information about:

- logging
- beans
- server stop/start

These should be built on the `Endpoint` API

### HTTP Server


#### HTTPS Support

HTTPS must be supported

#### Content Negotiation

Content negotiation must be supported

#### WebSocket Support

WebSocket Support must be implemented

#### Support for Views

Some view technology support and port GSON views to Particle.

### HTTP Client

#### Generate Client Implementation from Interface

It should be possible to generate a client implementation at compile time from a given interface

#### Service Discovery

A service discovery API is needed that is pluggable with different implementations and integrates with the client.

#### Client Side Load Balancing

In the case where multiple services of the same name exist client side load balancing should be activated automatically and transparently to the user

#### Distributed Tracing

Built in distributed tracing should be activated by default and allow integration with third-part tools (zipkin etc.)


### HTTP Gateway

An HTTP gateway that loads on port 8080 and uses the aforementioned HTTP client. The gateway need to be responsible for:

- JWT Token based authentication
- Load Balancing
- Starting Distributed Tracing
- Retry
- Rate limiting
- Route matching on HTTP Request (Path, Method, Header, Host, etc…​)
- Filters to modify downstream HTTP Request and HTTP Response (Add/Remove Headers, Add/Remove Parameters, Rewrite Path etc…​)

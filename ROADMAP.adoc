# Particle Requirements

## Minimum Feature Set

The following features are a TODO list of things to do on Particle before launching

### Core Features


#### Generate ConfigurationProperties documentation

We should generate asciidoc documentation for @ConfigurationProperties

#### Generic Type Abstraction for Factory Beans

This is currently not possible due to type erasure:

```
@Factory
class TypeConverterFactory {

    TypeConverter<String, Integer> typeConverter() {
        (string, integer, context) -> {
           // do conversion
        }
    }
}
```

At compile time we know the types but at runtime the lambda loses type information. We need to add an API to obtain type information for a bean from the factory.


#### AOP API

- We need to allow `Introduction` advise to specify additional interfaces that should be be implemented by the interceptor.
- Allow adding interfaces to non-abstract classes via introduction advise


#### Aspect Implementations

We need to implement AOP annotations for:

- Hystrix

### Configuration Sharing

Need a mechanism for configuration discovery and sharing across the federation. Configuration sharing should initially support:

* Consul
* Google Cloud (https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/runtime-configurator/reference/rest/)
* AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html and Example https://gist.github.com/ariesmcrae/b72aa0f986f87977ffc2de42481c8885)

### Service Discovery

* Amazon Route 53 (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/overview-service-discovery.html)
* Google Cloud Metadata Server (see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storing-retrieving-metadata?hl=en)

### Auto Configurations

We still need auto-configurations for the following:

* GORM for MongoDB
* Apache Kafka
* Cassandra

### Security / JWT Token Solution

Need to implement support for JWT token based authorization

### Management Features

#### Endpoints

We need endpoints for managing and/or exposing information about:

- logging
- info

These should be built on the `Endpoint` API.

#### Health Checks

Health checks still to be implemented:

* JDBC/SQL (kleeh in progress)
* Neo4j Driver


### HTTP Server


#### Content Negotiation

Content negotiation must be supported

#### WebSocket Support

WebSocket Support must be implemented

#### Support for Views

Some view technology support and port GSON views to Particle.

### HTTP Client

#### Distributed Tracing

Built in distributed tracing should be activated by default and allow integration with third-part tools (zipkin etc.)

### HTTP Gateway

An HTTP gateway that loads on port 8080 and uses the aforementioned HTTP client. The gateway need to be responsible for:

- JWT Token based authentication
- Load Balancing
- Starting Distributed Tracing
- Retry
- Rate limiting
- Route matching on HTTP Request (Path, Method, Header, Host, etc…​)
- Filters to modify downstream HTTP Request and HTTP Response (Add/Remove Headers, Add/Remove Parameters, Rewrite Path etc…​)

# Micronaut 

Micronaut is a modern, JVM-based, full stack microservices framework designed for building modular, easily testable microservice applications.

Micronaut is developed by the creators of the Grails framework and takes inspiration from lessons learnt over the years building real-world applications from monoliths to microservices using Spring, Spring Boot and Grails.

Micronaut aims to provide all the tools necessary to build microservice applications including:

* Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (IoC)
* Sensible Defaults and Auto-Configuration
* Configuration and Configuration Sharing
* Service Discovery
* HTTP Routing
* HTTP Client with Client-Side Load Balancing

At the same time Micronaut aims to avoid the downsides of frameworks like Spring, Spring Boot and Grails by providing:

* Fast startup time
* Reduced memory footprint
* Minimal use of reflection
* Minimal use of proxies
* Easy Unit Testing

For more information on using Micronaut see the documentation at [micronaut.io](http://micronaut.io)
